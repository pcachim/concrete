# Project *jupyter-concrete*

This project aims to develop a series of tools ([Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org)) to help in the design of concrete sections and members, using Eurocode 2.

The entry point is hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/pcachim/concrete). Notebooks can be executed using [Binder](https://mybinderr.org) oo you can doownload them and run them on your own Jupyter server. Link for a fully functional binder:
